## Overview

In this workshop you will create a skill called Pet Match that matches the user 
with a pet. When launched, this Alexa Skill will prompt the user for the 
information it needs to determine a match. Once all of the required information
is collected, it will send the data to an external web service which processes
the data and returns the match.

Through this workshop, you'll learn how to use advanced Alexa Skills Kit 
features to create and configure an Alexa Skill and AWS Lambda. Thefeatures you'll 
learn to use are Dialog Management and Entity Resolution. These features leverage
Alexa's Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Natural Language Understanding (NLU), 
and Machine Learning (ML), which makes your life easier because you don't have 
to write code. You only need to provide training data to the Alexa engines via your
interaction model. The skill builder makes it easy to do so.

## Pre-requistes

In order to start working on this workshop you will need:

*  <a href="https://aws.amazon.com" target="_new">AWS Account</a>
*  <a href="https://developer.amazon.com" 
target="_new">Amazon Developer Account</a>


## Get Started

The workshop is composed of three parts:

*  Part 1: Build and Customize Pet match
*  Part 2: Entity Resolution
*  Part 3: Memory

Each part contains a set of tasks that act as check points, and extra credit
that will present a challenge that will further enhance your learning.

**Note** You may use Pet Match as a starting point to build your own skill that
needs to collect information form the user and have processed via a web service.
You can customize the slots to match the data you need and change the hostname
to the web service you need to call.
